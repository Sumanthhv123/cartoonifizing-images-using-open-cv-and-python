Abstract

Cartoonification of images is a popular image processing technique that converts real-world images into cartoon-like images. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to create artistic effects, to improve the visibility of images in low-light conditions, or to reduce the file size of images.

One popular approach to cartoonification using OpenCV and Python is to use a combination of the following steps:

Convert the image to grayscale. This removes color information from the image, which can simplify the cartoonification process.
Apply a median blur to the image. This helps to smooth out the image and reduce noise.
Edge detection. This identifies the edges in the image, which can be used to create a cartoon-like effect.
Stylization. This step involves adjusting the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the image to create a more cartoon-like appearance.
